:::{.notes}
If we look at all the open source software specializing in dynamic mesh adaptation, there are two main families:
- patch-based, which is a hierarchical representation of the mesh: layers are placed on top of layers
- cell-based, which is a flat representation of the mesh

Each has its advantages and disadvantages:
- patch-based has rectangular zones for tiling and optimizing caches. But it generally requires more cells than necessary.
- cell-based requires far fewer cells but requires a tree-like structure, which means that you lose the good memory locality you had with patch-based. We use space filling curves such as Morton or Hilbert to find an acceptable locality.

:::{.notes}
If we look in a little more detail at the functions offered by these software packages, we can group them into 4 main families.

There are two types of data structure, as described above: a list of blocks or a tree.

There are two main adaptation criteria: one is based on a heuristic criterion and depends on the physical problem you are looking at. This could be a gradient, for example. The other is based on a wavelet decomposition that allows you to adapt the mesh without knowing anything about the physical problem, as we have just shown with Haar wavelets and multiresolution.

As you advance in time, you can choose different time steps depending on the resolution of the grid: this is called subcycling. Otherwise, you take the same time step everywhere and, in general, it is the finest grid that guides its value to satisfy a CFL.

Finally, given that the mesh is dynamic, the load balancing must be reviewed regularly during the calculation so that, in a parallel context, all the processes have more or less the same workload. There are two types of method: one based on the space filling curve, where you cut out chunks of the same size following this curve; the other is based on solving a diffusion equation on the workload of the processes.

:::{.notes}
Here's the samurai roadmap for the coming months and probably years.

We now have the possibility of changing the containers in which our fields are stored. We did this so that we could start using Kokkos. So we'd be very interested in working with the people at Cexa on this.

We have received several funding packages that have enabled us to hire two research engineers.

As part of numpex, we also have an engineer position to work on the I/O part of AMR methods in collaboration with Dyablo developers.
